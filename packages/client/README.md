# xuatz bookmark organiser

[![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/22af2c1116f0a0da638f/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/xuatz/xbo/maintainability)

This app aims to act as a curator of all your personal "bookmarks" from various websites and display them in a meaningful manner automagically.

You do not need to break your usage pattern, continue to add youtube videos to "Watch Later", save another 500 reddit posts that you will never revisit and add yet another webpage to Pocket. This application will pull from the various services that you use and attempt to organise them in meaningful ways such as:

1. group/order by websites
1. keyword count
1. click frequency
1. thumbs up/down
1. etc

## What can I do?

1. create account
2. login
3. logout
4. connect to Pushbullet
5. Tabs
   1. Home Page - Shows Urls and Notes
   1. Gallery - Shows media/photo
   1. Profile - connects to different data sources
   1. Organiser - Attempt to build a module to process bookmarks (tag, delete, other actions???)
6. inefficiently fetching latest pushes from pushbullet on every request
7. inefficiently fetching all pushes from server on every client request
8. infinity scroll
9. delete push at origin from client (without confirmation!!! DANGER)

## Get Started
