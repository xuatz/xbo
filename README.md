This app aims to act as a curator of all your personal "bookmarks" from various websites and display them in a meaningful manner automagically.

You do not need to break your usage pattern, continue to add youtube videos to "Watch Later", save another 500 reddit posts that you will never revisit and add yet another webpage to Pocket. This application will pull from the various services that you use and attempt to organise them in meaningful ways such as:

1. group/order by websites
1. keyword count
1. click frequency
1. thumbs up/down
1. etc
